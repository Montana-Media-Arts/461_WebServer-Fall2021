# Week 11 Overview

Welcome to Week 11!  We are going to talk through different web security strategies for both ASP.NET and PHP.

First, we will cover how to tie all of it together. We will look at how we access data by first getting data from our front-end.  Then, we will pass that data to our stored procedures, access the returned data in our code and then display the final result on the front end again. We will do this in both ASP.NET and PHP.
